This project focuses on building a web scraper using Scrapy to collect data from vnexpress.net, specifically targeting news related to the UEFA Champions League. The goal is to extract useful information such as article titles, publication dates, authors, content, tags, and links, which can then be saved into formats like CSV, Excel, or MySQL.

In addition, the project is integrated with Docker to create a containerized environment for easy deployment and execution of the scraping tasks. By leveraging Docker, users can seamlessly run the scraper without worrying about dependencies or local environment configuration.
